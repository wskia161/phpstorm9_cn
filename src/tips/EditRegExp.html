If there is an injection of some language in your code, you can edit it in a dedicated editor. </p>
<p>In particular, it is possible to edit regular expressions. Just start typing a regular expression, then press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:ShowIntentionActions;</span> and choose <span class="control">Edit RegExp</span>.
The regular expression opens in a separate tab in the editor, where you can type backslashes as is.</p> 
<p>All changes are synchronized with the original regular expression, and escapes are presented automatically. When ready, just press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorEscape;</span> to close the regular expression editor.</p>
